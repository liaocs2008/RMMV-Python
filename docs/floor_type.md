# Autotiles
It has been asked many times online about how the json data array works in RMMV, 
and how those tile ids result in the final map.
These online posts [1](https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/how-to-determine-your-tileid.91129/), 
[2](https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/autotile-tile-ids.2829/) 
give an excellent explanation.
Together with this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvdf6SM0N0k&t=463s) on creating customized autotile, 
you will be able to capture the gist of autotiles. 

## Demo
This is an [example](examples/autotile_map_generation.py) showing how to generate map given predefined data array in json files.

Here is [another example](examples/floor_type_picture.py) how to plot those 48 variants (in different directions) of given autotile.
